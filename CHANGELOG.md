# Changelog

All notable changes to IntelliGit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- IntelliJ-style stash accordion layout: each stash entry has a chevron toggle that expands its file tree inline directly below that entry, replacing the previous split list/tree layout.
- Draggable file tree height within expanded stash entries for resizing the file list area.
- Bottom "Coming..." placeholder panel below the Commit/Stash tabs with a draggable divider to resize.
- Bottom panel height persists across webview reloads via `vscode.getState()`.
- Loading indicator shown when stash entry is expanded but files are still being fetched from the extension host.
- Branch name validation with strict alphanumeric/dot/dash/underscore/slash rules for new branch and tag operations.
- Strict relative path assertions for all file operations dispatched from webviews to prevent path traversal.
- Stash shelving now supports untracked files (`--include-untracked` flag on `git stash push`).

### Changed

- Stash branch badge icon changed from tag icon to git branch icon, matching the branch panel.
- Stash branch badge color now uses `--vscode-gitDecoration-modifiedResourceForeground` instead of hardcoded `#d8ca64` for theme compatibility.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale branch metadata causing incorrect push-target resolution in "Push All up to Here": now refreshes branch cache on lookup miss instead of fabricating a synthetic branch object.
- Fixed potential leaked document event listeners and stuck body styles when ShelfTab unmounts mid-drag.

### Refactored

- Extracted `extension.ts` (2,021 lines) into focused modules, reducing it to ~520 lines (75% reduction):
  - `commands/branchCommands.ts`: 10 branch action handlers
  - `commands/commitCommands.ts`: 13 commit context actions
  - `services/diffService.ts`: file comparison and patch operations
  - `services/gitHelpers.ts`: shared git utilities (validation, resolution)
  - `services/jetbrainsMergeService.ts`: JetBrains merge tool orchestration
  - `services/refreshService.ts`: debounced refresh and file watchers
- Decomposed `MergeEditorApp.tsx` (1,477 lines) into focused modules:
  - `icons.tsx`: SVG icon components
  - `wordDiff.ts`: pure word-level diff algorithms
  - `mergeState.ts`: reducer and resolution helpers
  - `segments.tsx`: section components, code blocks, overview rail
- Extracted shared theme change listener utility (`themeListeners.ts`) to replace duplicated listener boilerplate across view providers.
- Removed duplicate stash/shelf method aliases (`stashSave`, `stashPop`, etc.) that were pure pass-throughs to canonical `shelve*` methods.

### Tests

- Added 65+ unit tests for extracted modules: `gitHelpers`, `wordDiff`, `mergeState` (total: 131 to 200).

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Shared "Group by Directory" toggle across Commit and Stash tabs: the toggle state is now lifted to the top-level app so both tabs respect the same setting. (PR #18 by sivertillia)
- Stash tab label renamed from "Shelf" to "Stash" for consistency with standard Git terminology.

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate "M" (Modified) status row appearing for newly staged files that were edited after staging. Only unstaged modifications are now suppressed for staged-add files; unstaged deletions (`AD` status) are still shown.
- Fixed `vscode.getState()` TypeError in test environments by using optional chaining (`vscode.getState?.()`) in the state initializer and effect.
- Fixed `useEffect` dependency array for `groupByDir` persistence to include `vscode` for React exhaustive-deps compliance.

### Tests

- Added test case verifying `groupByDir` defaults to `true` when `getState()` returns `undefined`.
- Updated VS Code API mocks to include `getState`/`setState` for `CommitPanelApp` test coverage.
- Narrowed overly broad DOM selectors (`querySelectorAll("*")`) in integration tests to use precise `title` attribute and `role="button"` selectors.
- Updated "Shelf" assertions and selectors to "Stash" across all test files.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed commit graph Changed Files double-click behavior so file rows now open a commit-to-parent diff (`<parent> ↔ <commit>`) as expected.
- Wired commit graph webview `openCommitFileDiff` events through the provider and extension host to reuse the same diff-opening path as the Commit Files view.

### Tests

- Added integration coverage for commit graph Changed Files double-click to assert `openCommitFileDiff` messaging and provider event forwarding.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed "ambiguous argument" error in commit graph when a branch used as filter is deleted. The stale branch reference is now cleared and the graph falls back to showing all branches.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed `groupByDir` setting not persisting across webview reloads. The toggle state is now saved to and restored from `vscode.getState()`. (PR #13 by sivertillia)
- Fixed `useCheckedFiles` overwriting all webview state keys on every update. State writes now merge with existing keys instead of replacing them.
- Excluded `.vexp/` from VSIX packaging to prevent build failures caused by non-file entries (Unix sockets).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed "Too many revisions specified 'stash@{N}'" error when clicking on a file in the shelf (stash) pane. Replaced `git stash show -p` with `git diff stash@{N}^ stash@{N}` for file-level patch retrieval, which correctly handles pathspec filtering across all git versions.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- External JetBrains merge tool integration for merge conflicts (PyCharm/IntelliJ IDEA/WebStorm and other JetBrains IDEs) using Git conflict stages (`base/ours/theirs`) and the IDE `merge` command.
- macOS `.app` bundle path support for JetBrains merge tool configuration, including automatic executable resolution from `Contents/Info.plist` (`CFBundleExecutable`) with fallback scanning of `Contents/MacOS`.
- JetBrains IDE auto-detection for merge tool setup:
    - macOS: `/Applications`, `~/Applications`, and JetBrains Toolbox installs
    - Windows: standard JetBrains install directories and JetBrains Toolbox installs
- `IntelliGit: Detect JetBrains Merge Tool` command with Quick Pick selection of detected JetBrains IDEs and manual-entry fallback.
- Editor context submenu `IntelliGit` (right-click in file editor) with:
    - `Compare with Revision`
    - `Compare with Branch`
- Git file comparison helpers to load file content at a selected revision/branch and open VS Code diffs against the working tree file.

### Changed

- `Open Merge Conflict` now uses only two merge editor paths:
    - JetBrains merge tool (when `intelligit.jetbrainsMergeTool.preferExternal` is enabled and a JetBrains path is configured)
    - VS Code internal merge editor (default fallback)
- IntelliGit custom merge editor is no longer used in the merge-conflict open flow.
- JetBrains merge tool path prompt now validates the entered path immediately and shows the resolved executable path in the confirmation message for easier setup/debugging.
- `intelligit.jetbrainsMergeTool.preferExternal` setting description updated to document VS Code internal merge editor fallback behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed macOS JetBrains `.app` path launch failures caused by trying to execute the app bundle directory directly (`EACCES`) by resolving the actual binary before launch.
- Fixed merge-conflict command registration syntax regression introduced while wiring JetBrains merge-tool commands.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Native VS Code file icon theme support across IntelliGit trees, including file, folder, and expanded-folder icons from the active `workbench.iconTheme`.
- Theme icon font support in webviews so icon themes that render glyph-based icons work correctly (not only SVG path icons).
- Folder name specific icon resolution (`folderNames`, `folderNamesExpanded`, `rootFolderNames`, `rootFolderNamesExpanded`) to match native explorer/source-control icon behavior.

### Changed

- Changed Files, Commit Files, Shelf Files, and Branch folder trees now resolve icons through the same native theme mapping path for consistent visuals.
- Commit panel file tree typography (row height, size, spacing, and weight) was adjusted to align with native Source Control list presentation.
- Commit panel now uses VS Code foreground color for commit file names instead of status-colored file-name text, matching native Source Control behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed cases where folder icons were missing or mismatched in Changed Files and Commit Files despite icon theme support being enabled.
- Fixed icon mismatches for compact/derived folder labels by normalizing folder-name lookup keys and leaf-segment fallbacks.
- Fixed branch tree folder icons not following the active file icon theme mappings.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Commit graph action types are now strict literal unions (`BranchAction`, `CommitAction`) with runtime guards for safer webview-to-extension messaging.

### Changed

- Marketplace metadata tuned for discoverability while keeping package name/description genericized for safer trademark posture.
- README project structure updated to reflect current modular React layout (`branch-column`, `commit-list`, `commit-panel`, shared modules).
- Commit list rendering switched from full list rendering to viewport virtualization for large-history performance.
- Branch remote-group header rendering now reuses `BranchSectionHeader` for consistent structure and reduced duplication.
- `useCommitGraphCanvas` now derives size from `rows.length` and uses a named left-padding constant.
- `TabBar` shared tab style object hoisted to module scope to avoid per-render reallocation.
- Commit list canvas rendering now clamps to viewport+overscan and redraws on scroll/resize/theme changes.
- Commit list load-more flow now guards against repeated triggers while a prior load is still in flight.

### Fixed

- Branch remote grouping now strips the exact grouped remote prefix instead of always stripping the first path segment.
- Context menu keyboard focus now has an accessible visible indicator (outline + focus ring) instead of suppressing outline.
- Commit info webview message handler now uses explicit discriminant handling before accessing `detail`.
- Branch section headers are now keyboard-accessible (`role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `Enter/Space`, `aria-expanded`).
- HEAD row now supports keyboard activation and keyboard context-menu invocation.
- Main/master icon detection now uses normalized branch short names (handles `origin/main`, etc.).
- Branch highlight regex no longer uses unnecessary global flag.
- Branch name trimming logic now safely handles small max lengths without negative slicing.
- Branch selected-row background now follows VS Code theme token (`--vscode-list-activeSelectionBackground`).
- `useCheckedFiles` folder/section toggle wrappers consolidated through a shared callback.
- `DragResizeOptions` is now exported for external typing/re-export.
- Commit panel tree types no longer store redundant `fileCount`; callsites now derive from `descendantFiles.length`.
- `collectDirPaths` now uses an accumulator to avoid recursive array spreading overhead.
- Commit/branch/context-menu integration tests were hardened with shared jsdom React test utilities and more realistic interaction assertions.

- Extension branch command handlers and commit selection errors now consistently use shared `getErrorMessage(...)`.
- Git numstat/stash-show warnings now log via a shared IntelliGit output channel (with fallback) instead of silent/console-only catches.
- Status/numstat failures now provide short user-facing warnings when displayed diff statistics may be incomplete.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-18

- Branch panel inline search box with:
    - live case-insensitive substring filtering
    - highlighted match segments in branch names

    - Branch panel
    - Context menus
    - Shelf tab
- Branch context menu layout:
    - tighter left padding and reduced extra gutter
    - improved popup placement near branch row icon/right-click anchor
    - stronger shadow/depth treatment
- Branch panel header:
    - reduced spacing under search/header area
    - `HEAD` label now shows current branch name (`HEAD (<branch>)`)
- Branch panel typography/spacing:
    - reduced row vertical padding and margins for denser tree layout
    - improved indentation for nested branch folders and branch children
- Commit panel typography:
    - standardized Chakra fonts to VS Code font variables for consistent family across panels.
- Commit files tree and shelf list styling aligned closer to IntelliJ row heights, spacing, selection color, and button geometry.
- Toolbar/icon spacing and visual alignment across commit/shelf tabs.

### Removed

- Branch context menu option: `Compare with '<branch>'`.
- Branch context menu option: `Show Diff with Working Tree`.
- Related extension command contributions and handlers for both removed options.
- Extra icons/actions next to `Amend` in commit area (as requested).

### Fixed

- Commit files tree collapse behavior:
    - collapsed folders no longer auto-expand unexpectedly
    - collapse all now preserves expected root visibility behavior
- Checkbox visual/size consistency in commit files tree:
    - reduced size to better match folder icon scale and IntelliJ feel.
- Changed Files interactions:
    - clicking files opens diff reliably
    - context menus restored after regressions (instead of default browser menu)
- Commit files tree indentation:
    - reduced over-indentation for deeper nested paths.
- Branch tree indentation:
    - improved child branch indentation under grouped prefixes.
- Commit panel path wrapping/truncation:
    - long path segments use available width better, with reduced unwanted wrapping.
- Context menu layout regressions:
    - corrected item spacing, ordering, disabled-state styling, and alignment.
- Right-click context behavior on:
    - commit rows
    - changed files
    - branches
- Shelf panel behavior:
    - shelf actions and layout corrected
    - shelf file changes displayed in tree format like Changed Files
    - apply/pop/delete controls and styling aligned.
- Dotfile icon detection:
    - files like `.eslintrc.json` now resolve to correct extension icon (`json`) instead of generic dotfile fallback.
- JSON badge token conflict:
    - JSON label is now distinct from JavaScript badge text.
- Context menu viewport clamping:
    - reposition recalculates when menu item count/content changes.

- File context command handlers now have safer async error handling:
    - `fileRollback`
    - `fileShelve`
    - `fileShowHistory`
    - success/info and error feedback are surfaced consistently.
- `fileDelete` error handling now discriminates expected “not tracked/pathspec” cases from unexpected errors.
- Workspace safety guard added for webview file operations:
    - avoids crashes when no workspace folder is open.
- `git rm` behavior made safer:
    - `deleteFile` supports optional `force`
    - default path avoids forced deletion of modified files.

### Architecture and Maintainability

- Continued migration toward reusable React components and shared styling patterns.
- Centralized/shared context menu and tree rendering improvements used across panels.
- Multiple UI consistency passes to reduce raw/one-off styling divergence and improve production readiness.
